{"changed":true,"filter":false,"title":"README.md","tooltip":"/README.md","value":"# Fullstack-Project\n\nI have created this website as a project for my Fullstack with Django module. It is an e-commerce site. I chose to do this type of application for the dual purpose of creating a site for my wife to sell her quilts on as well. The email and shopping functions don't actually work at this time, simply because they aren't needed yet. All of the frameworks are in place, just disabled.\n\n## UX\n\nWhen i chose to do the e-commerce site for my project, I instantly thought of my wife's dream of selling the quilts that she makes. The target audience for the site is generally anyone looking for handmade quilts to buy\n\n### User Stories\n\n- As a shopper, I want to purchase a quilt as a gift.\n...\n- As a happy customer, I want to email the seller to say thank you.\n...\n- As a shopper, I want an easy to view layout with images of the product.\n...\n- As a frequent shopper, I want to create an account so i won't have to enter my info every time I make a purchase.\n\nThis section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.\n\n### Features\n\n\n## Existing Features\n\n- Email - allows shoppers/customers to contact the seller by filling out a basic email form.\n...\n- Purchase - allows shoppers/customers to view and purchase available inventory by adding the item to a cart\n...\n- Cart - allows shoppers/customers to save products in a temporary shopping cart until ready to check-out\n...\n- Check-out - allows shoppers/customers to purchase the saved items in thier cart\n\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n### JQuery\n- https://jquery.com/\nThe project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.\n\n### Django\n- https://www.djangoproject.com/\nThe project uses Django for many tasks, including dbstorage, admin functions\n\n### Python\n- https://www.python.org/\nThe project used Python for site creation and app management\n\n### Bootstrap\n- https://getbootstrap.com/\nThe project uses Bootstrap for the layout, stylings, and grid system\n\n### AWS\n- https://aws.amazon.com/\nThe project uses Amazon Web Services for the C9 terminal, S3 for storage, as well as IAM for user management\n\n## Testing\n\nIn this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.\n\nWhenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/teetsjeremy/fullstack-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/teetsjeremy/fullstack-project)\n\nFor any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:\n\n1. Contact form:\n    1. Go to the \"Contact Us\" page\n    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears\n    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears\n    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.\n    \n\nIn addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.\n\nYou should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.\n\nIf this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThis section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).\n\nIn particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:\n\nDifferent values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?\nDifferent configuration files?\nSeparate git branch?\nIn addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.\n\n## Credits\n\n### Content\n\n1.
